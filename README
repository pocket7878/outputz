*outputz* is a Vim plugin to provide the feature that the number of bytes you
inputted will be automatically posted to outputz.com whenever a whole buffer
is written to a file.

Note that this is just a prototype.  The interface should be improved for the
future.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- curl - http://curl.haxx.se/

Latest version:
